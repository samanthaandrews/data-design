		<h1>Data Design - Medium</h1>
		<div>
		<h2>Persona</h2>
			<img src="woman-gloria-persona.jpeg" alt="Photo of Gloria" width="500"/>
		<p>Gloria Fisher</p>
		<p>Woman</p>
		<p>51 years old, has three adult children</p>
		<p>iPad Pro, 10.5”, with detachable keyboard, intermediate user (the iPad is new to Gloria but she is a long time user of Apple mobile devices and computers)</p>
		<p>Gloria is a Physics Professor at a large, public University. This year, she is starting a two year sabbatical. During her time off, she will travel around the world in an attempt to identify every bird species. She wants to write blog posts about her bird watching adventures using Medium as her blogging platform. She chose Medium because her youngest daughter (age 21) said it was simple to use. Gloria wants to focus on writing and posting photos rather than learning to manage her own website. She decided that the iPad was best portable device for her journey around the world, since it is smaller and lighter than a laptop.</p>
