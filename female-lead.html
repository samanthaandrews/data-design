		<h1>Female Lead</h1>
		<p>If I were to hire a strong female lead, I would hire someone who is strong and hard working. She might even do
			her own stunts. As a professional actor, she is experienced. She knows how to put her own spin on the character
			she is portraying, but also open to criticism and able to take direction. She is human and therefore makes
			mistakes, but always puts her best foot forward as a professional.</p>
		<blockquote>Her motto: “Have an opinion, make work that matters, and care about something other than yourself.”
		</blockquote>
		<p>In terms of the character she will portray, she fights for what is right, especially if it means putting
			herself at risk or going against the status quo. Rebelliousness is a key character trait. She isn’t meek or
			understated, rather opinionated. She gets messy. Dirt and grime and blood don’t scare her. She doesn’t try to
			look cool or sexy while she is in battle and makes really ugly, scary faces to intimidate the bad guys. She might have tattoos or scars, perhaps even missing an eye.</p>
		<p>Basically, I would want to hire Charlize Theron since I thought she did an amazing job playing Furiosa in <em>Mad
			Max: Fury Road.</em></p>
